#### Root METS administrative metadata section (element amdSec)

The eHealth1 CITS specification does not change or extend any of the requirements already defined by the CSIP or IP specificationsâ€™ administrative metadata section. The eHealth1 root METS document amdSec element SHOULD comply with the amdSec requirements in the CSIP profile. Note that in eHealth1, it is required that any rights or digital provenance metadata that is general to the package should be held within the root metadata folder and that any rights or digital provenance metadata that is specific to the data held in the representations should be held in the respective representation metadata folder.

#### Root METS file section (element fileSec)

The CSIP does not make the use of the METS fileSec element mandatory, but it is strongly recommended. In the eHEALTH CITS, the use of the METS fileSec element at the package level becomes mandatory, such as to reference the mets files within each representation.
