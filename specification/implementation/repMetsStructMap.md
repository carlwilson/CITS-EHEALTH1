#### Representation METS structural map (structMap element)

The METS structural map element is the only mandatory element in the METS specification and is hence mandatory within the representation METS. The representation METS.xml is referenced from the package METS.xml via the <mptr> element, and hence the requirements for the structMap element within the package METS.xml (CSIP requirements CSIP80 to CSIP118) are unchanged. Because a representation is present, the need for a Content Division in the package METS.xml structMap is not required (CSIP101 to CSIP112 and CSIP 116, 118 and 119).

There MUST be one structural map present following the requirements of the CSIP.
