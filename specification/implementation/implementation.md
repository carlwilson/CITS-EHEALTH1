# Implementation

## Use of METS in eHealth1

CSIP specifies that METS files be located at the root of the package folder structure (Root METS) and optionally in each of the representations within its respective root folder (Representation METS).

### Root METS File

The root METS file must adhere to the requirements of the CSIP and Information Package specifications. In addition, there are specific requirements for the eHealth1 CITS, and in some cases, the level of the CSIP or package requirements have been increased (but never decreased).

#### Root METS root element

The eHealth1 CITS specification does not change or extend any of the requirements for the Root METS root element. Information is given below regarding the specific content type attributes to be used in an eHealth1 CITS.
