        The purpose of this document is to provide background and context for the Content Information Type
        Specification (CITS) for Patient Medical Records (eHealth1). The specification is further supported by
        METS profiles for the Root and Representation METS files. The initial development of the specification
        was based on work done at the Norwegian National Health Archive (NHA) and is being enhanced and
        developed further through community feedback.
