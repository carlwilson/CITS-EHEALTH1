title: "CITS eHealth1"
subtitle: "E-ARK Content Information Type Specification for Patient Medical Records"
abstract: |
        The eHealth1 specification is built upon work done by the Directorate for Health
        in Norway on the establishment of a standard for electronically extracting health
        records from healthcare provider Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and their
        submission to a central health archive. The use cases envisaged for the central
        health archive are: a. to provide records to next of kin in compliance with open
        information regulation and b. to harvest the vast amount of historical
        healthcare-related data for medical research. The CITS takes input from the Norwegian
        specification on the structure of extractions from submitting systems and puts this
        into a framework that is compliant with the EARK common and package specifications.
        The eHealth1 specification also recommends the use of international domain standards
        for descriptive metadata. The specification is accompanied by two METS profiles for
        the Root and Representations within the packages.
